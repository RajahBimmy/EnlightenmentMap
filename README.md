# Enlightenment Check-In Data

This Javascript project visualizes the significance of spatial identity during the age of the enlightenment by following works like Voltaire's _Candide_, Defoe's _Robinson Crusoe_, and Equiano's _Interesting Narrative_.

## Use:

To use the application, open it via [this](project.html) link, and select which character's journey you want to see plotted to the graph. Then select on any one of the locations for a more detailed description of who did what there. Any places which hold a heavier amount of significance to a specific character are marked with larger bubbles. Robinson Crusoe's voyages are marked in yellow, Candide's in hotpink, and Equiano's in purple. If you encounter any difficulties using this resource, please open an issue and notify me. I'll fix it right away.
